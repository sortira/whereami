        <h1 class="display-2">Hi Abhijit <i>bhaiya</i></h1>
        <p class="lead">This page states some of the design motives behind the UI/UX experience and shows a couple of
            smooth animations and transitions because I know you like them (and to show that I know how to <i>code</i>
            them üòõ</p>

        <h3 class="display-3">Why does <i>Where Am I?</i> lack fancy UI/UX?</h3>
        <p class="lead"> <i>(Don't click this div before reading it completely)</i> Well, the secret behind <i>Where Am
                I?</i> is quite simple: during my endless hours of studying, I found it impossible to locate a game that
            didn‚Äôt scream ‚Äúdistraction‚Äù at me or induce an addiction worse than that of a cat meme. As a quiz
            aficionado, I dreamed of a game that wouldn't divert my attention from important things, like questioning my
            life choices. So, I decided to create <i>Where Am I?</i> that would shun all those flashy dopamine triggers.
            You know, the kind that makes you forget your homework and instead leads you into the black hole of the
            internet. Oh, and don‚Äôt worry, my lack of UI/UX skills is a minor issue‚Äîwho needs aesthetics when you can
            have fun? <br />
            Apart from being a website, it also has PWA support, so you can play it offline (single-player) <br />
            Oh, and I‚Äôm ready for you to click this section now. Trust me, the magic will happen!

        <h3 class="display-3">Ok, but a game with no leaderboard? No competitive?</h3>
        <p class="lead"><i>(You may move the cursor over this section for fun) </i>Ah, the competitive spirit! I mean,
            who wouldn‚Äôt want to turn a perfectly good knowledge-building experience into a battlefield? But let‚Äôs be
            real‚Äî<i>Where Am I?</i> is about giving your brain a well-deserved break from the relentless grind. The last
            thing I want is for my serious users to engage in a duel over <i>Where Am I?</i>. No thanks! The aim here is
            enlightenment, not warfare.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">That being said, if you really want to get competitive, try out the multiplayer mode. It‚Äôs a
            great way to level up and challenge your friends.</p>
